## **2. Deployment on Azure**

### **2.1 Prerequisites**
- An Azure subscription with sufficient permissions to deploy Web Apps.  
- Access to the naming policies and configuration files (if applicable).  
- .NET Core 6.0 or higher installed locally for testing (optional).  

### **2.2 Deployment Steps**
1. **Create an Azure Web App**:  
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal and create a new Web App.  
   - Choose the runtime stack: `.NET Core 6.0`.  
   - Configure the deployment region and hosting plan.  

2. **Deploy the Code**:  
   - Use Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or the Azure CLI for deployment. Example CLI command:  
     ```bash
     az webapp deployment source config --name <app_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --repo-url <repository_url>
     ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:  
   - Access the Web Appâ€™s configuration settings in the Azure Portal.  
   - Add any required app settings, such as database connection strings or API keys.  

4. **Test the Deployment**:  
   - Open the app URL (e.g., `https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`) and confirm functionality.
