# Introduction 
Today it typically takes 2 - 4 months to deploy an infrastructure in an enterprise, Evergreen's ECDF will bring it down to 2 - 4 days using the below...
A. IBB: Fully certified Infrastructure Building Blocks (IBB) for managed Azure environment for an Enterprise following Well Architected Framework and ITGC compliance.
e.g., Azure SQL Server with automated Infrastructure as Code with pre-baked ITGC (Minimum Security Baseline and Enterprise Best Practices).

B. AIB: Fully certified Application Infrastructure Blueprint (AIB) for a specific business solution and/or architecture pattern. The blueprint is built on top of the reusable IBBs under the hood to accelerate design & delivery.
e.g., 3-tier Web AIB using SQL Server IBB & App Service Plan IBB.
